Magnetotransport in thin cobalt films for spintronics applications


# Abstract
With the discovery of Graphene came the rapid research into the field of nanometer scale spintronics. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been used to exploit and enhance the properties of Graphene and ferromagnetic materials, like cobalt, have been used to inject and detect spins into the 2D structure. Building on previous work, a nanodevice was fabricated to measure the resistivity, AMR, thermopower and MTEP of cobalt on hBN and silicon dioxide. It was found that resistivity may was consitstent on hBN and SiO2 measured as (0.259 ± 0.002Random ± 0.013systematic)μΩm and (0.236 ± 0.003Random ± 0.007systematic)μΩm respectively, the difference attributed to different growth of cobalt on the two substrates. AMR was found to be 34% higher on SiO2 compared to on hBN at 0.75% compared to 0.56%. Thermopower was measured to be higher on hBN at (-39.0 ± 7.8Random ± 3.4systematic)μV/K with (-16.8 ± 3.3Random ± 2.1systematic)μV/K measured on SiO2. The difference here is believed to be due to the effect of hBN on the magnon drag contribution to thermopower. MTEP in cobalt was found to be consistent on the two substrates at (0.18±0.6)% for SiO2 and (0.13±0.8)% for hBN.
